/- NB:
Some lemmas in this file have an unnecessarily strong [OQM R] hypothesis
where [DUNLO R] (or maybe even nothing) would be enough;
that's just because they are lemmas about things which were defined
under a standing hypothesis of [OQM R].
Since the proofs of these "lemmas" are all omitted, it's also possible
that some required hypotheses (like [is_definable_le S R]) may be missing.

/- Remark:
In Type, `roption X` is the "partial map classifier X‚Å∫": Œ£ (œÜ : Œ©), X^œÜ.
(Here Œ© = Prop is the subobject classifier.)
f : K ‚Üí roption X cuts out a subset K' ‚äÜ K (where f is "defined"),
given by a pullback square

  K' ‚Üí X
  ‚Üì    ‚Üì
  K  ‚Üí X‚Å∫

We want K' to be defined and the restriction f' : K' ‚Üí X to be definable.
In this way, `roption X` models the "*definable* partial map classifier" for `X`.

We could also consider `option X = X ‚äï unit`, and under the "sheafy" semantics
of ‚äï, we would end up with an equivalent definable_psh structure.
This is not because the topos of sheaves on Def is boolean (it isn't)
but because we choose to interpret `Prop` as the classifier for *definable* subobjects
and, in Sh(Def), definable subobjects are decidable (complementable).
(Contrast Sh(ùîª, closed topology) [ùîª = definable sets + *continuous* definable maps]
where definable or even closed subobjects are not decidable--only clopen subobjects are.
If we force definable subobjects to be decidable, we turn Sh(ùîª) into Sh(Def).)
