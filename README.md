# lean-omin

A project to formalize the theory of [o-minimal structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-minimal_theory) in Lean.

## Directory layout

* `src/omin` is a playground for new ideas,
  and may contain unfinished proofs or even definitions,
  temporary names, and so on.

* `src/o_minimal` is the "official" formalization
  and is supposed to avoid `sorry`,
  although it is still at a highly experimental phase.

* `for_mathlib` contains supporting developments.
